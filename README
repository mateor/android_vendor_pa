Paranoid Android for Nook Color

This readme is for ICS. We'll add 4.1 next week sometime.

Okay, this buld process is completely untested, since I just threw the xml together. I won't even say it should work. 

But it might, and if it does, it will be easy.

SET-UP

Install the dependencies. This includes JDK, SDK and a bunch of packages. 
Follow the wiki 

http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble_Nook_Color:_Compile_CyanogenMod_(Linux)

when it says to sync a branch, use this instead

$ repo init -u git://github.com/mateor/android.git -b ics

This should grab everything you need, no need for local_manifest.xml. 

If it doesn't, well then I need to edit my default.xml. Let me know!
------------------------------

TO BUILD
$ . build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch
[pick whichever number pa_encore_userdebug is. It should be the last on the list (82 or so)]
$ make bacon

that is it. SOOSOSOSOSOSO easy, amirite?

The ROM should be found at $PWD/out/target/product/encore/pa_encore-1.6aETC.zip

Enjoy!
